## What's the intention of this repository?
Mostly, the goal is to learn (more or less) everything about web development.
Starting from getting an idea what to build, over planning what to do next up to coding the actual application.
Also getting into working with others on such a project is something, I want to accomplish with this project.


## Can I already contribute?
Simple answer - Yes!
Unfortunately, there are currently no contribution guidelines for this project and therefore there is no "correct way" to contribute.
If you have an suggestion for something that could be improved, simply do a PR (Pull Request).

I'm happy about anyone who wants to help. ðŸ’ª
